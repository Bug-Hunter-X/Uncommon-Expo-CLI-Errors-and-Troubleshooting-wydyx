Debugging uncommon Expo CLI errors often requires a systematic approach.  Here's a breakdown of strategies:

1. **Check the Full Error Message:** Carefully examine the entire error message.  Look for specific file paths, module names, or error codes. This information can provide crucial clues.

2. **Clean and Reinstall Dependencies:** Run `expo prebuild` followed by `expo install` and `yarn cache clean` (or `npm cache clean --force` if using npm). Sometimes corrupted or conflicting dependencies cause cryptic errors.

3. **Examine Package.json:** Review your `package.json` file, ensuring all dependencies are compatible with each other and your Expo SDK version. Use a dependency resolution tool to identify potential conflicts.

4. **Verify Native Modules:** If the error relates to a native module, ensure it's correctly configured and linked. Check the module's documentation for platform-specific instructions.

5. **Inspect Build Logs:** The build logs often contain detailed information about errors. Look for messages related to linking, compilation, or other build processes. 

6. **Test on a Simulator/Emulator:** If possible, reproduce the error on a simulator or emulator first to isolate potential device-specific issues. 

7. **Create a Minimal Reproducible Example:** If you can't resolve the error, create a minimal project that demonstrates the issue. This helps narrow down the cause and allows others to assist.

8. **Check Expo Forums and Issue Tracker:** Search the Expo forums and issue tracker to see if others have encountered similar errors and their resolutions. 

**Example scenario and code (expoBug.js):**

Let's say you encounter an error related to a missing native module like react-native-camera. The error message might indicate that the module can't be found or linked. The solution would involve carefully following the installation instructions of the library, ensuring that you have all necessary platform dependencies, and that it's properly linked in your project's build configuration. 

// expoBug.js - (Illustrative example; replace with the actual code)

import { Camera } from 'react-native-camera'; // Error might occur here if module not properly linked

function App() {
  return (
    <Camera />
  );
}


// expoBugSolution.js - (Illustrative example)

//Solution might involve checking react-native-camera documentation, verifying installation steps, ensuring linking has occurred correctly across android and ios.
