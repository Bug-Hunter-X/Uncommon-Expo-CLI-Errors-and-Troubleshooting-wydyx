# Uncommon Expo CLI Errors and Troubleshooting

This repository documents some uncommon errors encountered while using the Expo CLI, along with their solutions.  These errors often go beyond the typical issues documented in the official Expo documentation.  The focus is on problems related to native module integration, dependency conflicts, and intricacies of the build process.

Each error is described with its symptoms, potential causes, and a step-by-step solution.  Code examples are provided to illustrate the issues and their fixes.
